There is a paid for option but it is about $5 a month so for the amount I use it just not work it.

I tried to just put the vault in google drive but I just couldn't read the files via obsidian.

I now do this.

Make any edits in obsidian then when I want to sync it I use git with vscode.

Via terminal 

```
cd Documents
code Obsidian
```

Enter a message then click Commit.
