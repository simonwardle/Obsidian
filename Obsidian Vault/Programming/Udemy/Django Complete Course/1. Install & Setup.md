Basic steps to get Django installed and running.

Lets assume you have created the following folders.
This is what I did to run this course.
~\Source\Python\DennisIvy
cd into the folder named above.

### Setup a python virtual environment.

```
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Your shell prompt should indicate you are working in the virtual environment .venv.

```
pip list 
```

The above should prove that you have a fresh environment with nothing installed.

### Install Django

```
pip install django
```

### Create our project devsearch

```
django-admin startproject devsearch
```

In the current folder we should now have a new folder devsearch which holds our Django project.

To open the project simple start VS Code.
```
code devsearch
```

If you open a terminal in VS Code you may notice it is not using the virtual environment.
To fix this simple do this.

```
cd ..
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To deactivate the environment.
```
deactivate
```

After deactivating I have noticed the terminal in VS Code still signifies that the environment is active when it actually isn't, to prove it isn't just try pip list if django isn't listed but lots of other packages are, then the environment is no longer active and it is just the prompt that is screwed.  To fix the prompt.

```
export PS1="\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ \[\]"
```

To test you have Django installed and running.
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Then start a browser. (port 8000)

### Resetting the Prompt
To make resetting the prompt and environment easier run the following script.

```
source ./resetEnv.sh
```

The script does this...

deactivate
export PS1="\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]{debian_chroot:+(debian_chroot)}\[\03301;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ \[\]"
cd ~/Source/Python/DennisIvy
source .venv/bin/activate
cd devsearch
pip list 

## Apps
In Django it is good practice to separate a project into smaller apps.

The diagram below shows one project with two apps.
The initial command startproject  created the website and the area shaded in purple, this includes the maange.py script.

### Create an App
```
python3 manage.py startapp projects
```

![[Pasted image 20250715193457.png]]

Once the projects app has been created we tell the devsearch project more information about it to enable the project to be able to use the app.

Open projects -> apps.py and copy the name of the class in there.  It should be something like this - ProjectsConfig.
Next go to devsearch -> settings.py and find the INSTALLED_APPS list.
Insert the class into the list it should then look like this.
