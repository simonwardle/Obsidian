#laravel #Routes

Routes are created in the routes folder using the web.php file.

Here is a very simple example:

```
<?php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/', function () {
return view('home');
});

Route::get('/about', function () {
return "This is the About Page";
});
```

For the above to work you would also need a blade template home.blade.php this would need to be held in the resources/views folder.  The /about route will simply display your string.

The above is called a closure function.  The closure function is also known as the action see below screen shot.

Route:: is basically a php class with various methods or functions implemented such as get() and post().


## Passing Parameters
Below is an example of passing a parameter (id) to our /user route.

```
Route::get('/user/{id}', function () {
return "Hello user";
});
```

To use the above route in the browser simply browse to localhost:8000/user/1 where 1 could be anything.

To get the parameter that was passed in the url, very simply just change to the following.
```
Route::get('/user/{id}', function ($id) {
return "Hello user " . $id;
});
```
The result would be "Hello user 1".


## Passing multiple parameters
Passing more than one.
```
Route::get('/user/{id}/{slug}', function ($id, $slug) {
return "Hello user " . $id . '-' . $slug;
});
```
The above would return something like this...

The long winded way to define routes in the web.php is as follows

```
Route::get('/jobs/{id}', function ($id) {
	$job = Job::find($id);
	return view('jobs.show', ['job' => $job]);
});
```

There is a better way but you must follow conventions.
The above can be replaced with this.

```
Route::get('/jobs/{job}', function (Job $job) {
	return view('jobs.show', ['job' => $job]);
});
```

Notice the {job} in the get must have the same name as the variable passed into the function and the variable must have a type specified in this case Job.

Because you have specified the type Job Laravel knows to try and give you a Job type.


## Naming a Route
To name a route simple add the name to the end.
```
Route::get('/', function () {
return view('home');
})->name('home');

Route::get('/about', function () {
return view('about');
})->name('about');

Route::get('/user/{id}/{slug}', function ($id, $slug) {
return "Hello user " . $id . '-' . $slug;
})->name('user');
```

Then to use the named route it is as easy as this..
```
<ul>
	<li><a href="{{ route('home')}}">Home</a></li>
	<li><a href="{{ route('about')}}">About</a></li>
	<li><a href="{{ route('user', ['id' => 1, 'slug' => '100'])}}">User</a></li>
</ul>
```

In the above blade layout file we are using echo statements {{  }} notice the function route() accepts an array.

## Route Groups

It is possible to create a group of routes like this...
![[Pasted image 20241001145132.png|450]]

It is possible to extend the groups further like this...
![[Pasted image 20241001150251.png|550]]
The above will inject the word blog. into the name of each route so create will become blog.create.  The url is also extended to become /blog/create.

## Route Methods
The Laravel Route class has the following 5 methods.

1. GET  - Used to get data
2. POST  - Submit/Store data
3. PUT  - Update data (entire row)
4. PATCH  - Update data (just a portion of the row)
5. DELETE  - Delete data.


## Fallback Routes

Laravel has a default fallback if you try to browse to a undefined route Laravel will fallback to 404 page not found, but this can be overridden.

```
Route::fallback(function() {
	return "Ooops we couldn't find that page!"
});
```

The fallback route needs to be at the bottom of the route list.


## Route Views

If you want to simply call a view from a route with no other logic in place, Laravel has a short cut.  
Replace this..
```
Route::get('/', function () {
	return view('home');
});
```

With this..
```
Route::view('/', 'home');
```

It just makes web.php cleaner.


## Route Resources

Laravel is really clever if you stick to conventions and name your functions as previously shown.  (index, create, show, store, edit, update and destroy).  Instead of naming each route as shown in previous sections you can replace with this.

Route::resource('jobs', JobController::class);

If you delete the existing route group for the job and replace it with the line above everything will simply just work.   Laravel automatically just sets everything up to follow the typical convention.  This only works if you are consistent with the naming conventions.

If you don't need to generate all seven resourceful  routes Laravel does have an extension.
To generate the resource for all actions except edit you could do this..
```
Route::resource('jobs', JobController::class,[
	'except' => ['edit']
]);
```

To only create an index and a show you could do this..

```
Route::resource('jobs', JobController::class,[
	'only' => ['index', 'show']
]);
```


## Route Listing

To get a neat list of just your routes use the following artisan command

```
php artisan route:list --except-vendor
```
