To  create a blade template or view you can do it manually by creating  a file in the resource/views folder but you must follow the standard naming convention.  "contact.blade.php".
An alternative method is to use artisan.

```
php artisan make:view contact
```

The above will create a basic blade template in the correct folder with the correct naming convention.

## Blade Directives
These are basically a short cut method for writing php code. 
All directives start with @ symbol.

Here are a couple of examples
@if()
@endif

@for()
@endfor

There is even a php directive that allows you write php code in your html view.

Notice the  {{ $title }} above this is how we echo.

## Comments
Blade comments are {{-- Existing text --}}
The vscode short cut is Ctrl /

## Passing Data to Blade File
Here is an example of how to do this from the route.
```
Route::get('/', function(){
	$title = 'Home Page';
	$films = ['Rambo', 'Titanic', 'Star Wars'];
	return view('home', ['title' => $title, 'films'=> $films]);
});
```

Then in the blade template.
```
<h2>{{ $title }}</h2>
	<ul>
		@foreach ($films as $film)
			<li>{{ $film }}</li>
		@endforeach
	</ul>
```

## Extending a Template
This is the process of breaking down pages into section and then programmatically rebuilding them.
A page is often made up of a repeating header and footer with content in the middle.  Blade templates allow you to extend your layout by injecting your content into it at a selected point.

Create your layout page with the header and footer leaving space for the content to be injected in using the @yield directive. Below is an extract from app.blade.php (or it could be named layout.blade.php the naming is irrelevant)

Back in your content page you need to use the @extends and @section directives as below.

This approach allows easier maintenance, the header and footer appear on every page but exist in just one file.

## Including Sub-Views
It is also possible to inject other views into your blade template using the @include directive.

The above will simply inject the gallery blade file at the position shown.

## Conditional Rendering
In a view there may be sections you want to show or hide based on a condition this is possible using the @if blade directive small example below.

```
@if (Auth::user()->role == 'admin')  
    <div class="py-6 pt-6">  
        <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8">  
            <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 overflow-hidden shadow-sm sm:rounded-lg">  
                <div class="p-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">  
                    {{ __("You're Admin!") }}  
                </div>  
            </div>  
        </div>  
    </div>  
@endif
```
The laravel documentation about all these is pretty straight forward.

## Stacks
Blade allows you to ==push== to named stacks which can be rendered somewhere else in another view or layout. This can be particularly useful for specifying any JavaScript libraries required by your child views.

The pushed code is placed in the layout wherever the @stack directive with the same name is found.
