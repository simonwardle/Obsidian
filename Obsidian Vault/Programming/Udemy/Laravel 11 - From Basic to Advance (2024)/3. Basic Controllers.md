To quickly generate a new controller, you may run the ==make:controller== Artisan command. By default, all of the controllers for your application are stored in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory:

```
php artisan make:controller UserController
```

Let's take a look at an example of a basic controller. A controller may have any number of public methods which will respond to incoming HTTP requests:

```
<?php 

namespace App\Http\Controllers; 
use App\Models\User;use Illuminate\View\View; 

class UserController extends Controller{   

/**     
* Show the profile for a given user.     
*/    

	public function show(string $id): View{        
		return view('user.profile', [            
		'user' => User::findOrFail($id)]);    
	}
}
```

Once you have written a controller class and method, you may define a route to the controller method like so:

```
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController; 
Route::get('/user/{id}', [UserController::class, 'show']);
```

When an incoming request matches the specified route URI, the `show` method on the `App\Http\Controllers\UserController` class will be invoked and the route parameters will be passed to the method.
