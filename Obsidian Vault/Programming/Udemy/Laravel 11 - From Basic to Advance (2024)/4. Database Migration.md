Use php artisan to create database migrations.  Database migration are basically php code used to connect to your database and perform some sort of SQL action such as creating a table.  Like most things there is a convention for creating tables in your database and naming the migrations.

Here is an example artisan command to create a DB table named blogs.  (Notice it is blogs plural)

```
php artisan make:migration create_blogs_table
```

The above command will create a php class in the database/migrations folder.

The previous migrations will already have been run when you initialised your Laravel app.
Note: The new table will not yet exist in the database.  As the initial migrations ran at create time the database will already have these tables.

The create_blogs_table migration will have 2 functions, up and down.  If you followed the standard naming conventions Laravel will know to create a table with the name "blogs".

```
public function up(): void
{
	Schema::create('blogs', function (Blueprint $table) {
		$table->id();
		$table->timestamps();
	});
}
```

Above is the boilerplate from the artisan command.  To add further columns simply edit the function.  A full list of column types can be found here...

https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/migrations#available-column-types

<u>Example</u>

```
public function up(): void
{
	Schema::create('blogs', function (Blueprint $table) {
		$table->id();
		$table->string('title');
		$table->text('description);
		$table->timestamps();
	});
}
```

To create the table in the database we simply need to run...

```
php artisan migrate
```

Back in Table Plus or MyPHPAdmin you should now find the new table.

Notice that timestamps created 2 columns automatically for us.


## Migration Commands

If you run php artisan list it will give a full list of all the artisan commands here are the ones specific to migrations.

![[Pasted image 20241004184826.png|550]]

### migrate:fresh
Drops the entire database schema and then executes all migrations from the beginning.

### migrate:refresh
Rolls back all migrations and then executes them again, essentially recreating the database structure. This command is useful for development and testing.  Your database will be blank after this.

### migrate reset
Rolls back all your migrations.
This will basically remove all your tables leaving just the migration table.
### migrate:rollback
Reverts the last batch of migrations applied to the database. This command can be used to roll back to a specific point in time by using the  ==--date== option with a date string. 

To roll back only the latest migration, use ==php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1.==
To roll back the last two migrations, use ==php artisan migrate:rollback --step=2.==


If you want to see the SQL Laravel will create then pass the php artisan command the following 

```
 migrate --pretend
```

## Adding a new column to a previous migration

Once you have run your migrations detailed above you may have inserted some valuable data into you table that you don't want to lose but you need to add a new column.  If you just add the column into the existing migration it won't add the column to the db unless you are prepared to run one of the refresh commands at which point you will loose all your data.  Below describes how to add a new column to your table and preserve your data.

First simply create a new migration giving it a meaningful name.

```
php artisan make:migration add_author_to_blogs_table --table=blogs
```

Edit the new migration adding your new column to the function.

![[Pasted image 20241008142813.png|500]]
Code to insert a new column after the "id" column.
```
$table->string('author')->nullable()->after('id');
```

In the down function you will need to add this code.
```
$table->dropColumn('author');
```

Save your changes and run...
```
php artisan migrate
```

If you check you table it should now have the new column and all your data will be in-tacked.

## Symbols
If you want to have symbols like this in your code.

![[Pasted image 20241008171000.png|500]]
Install the font fira code.
```
sudo apt install fonts-firacode
```

Then Ctrl + , will take you to settings select  Text Editor, Font and update to Fira Code. Then Edit in settings.json.

Make sure it looks like this.

Restart VS Code and all should be working.
