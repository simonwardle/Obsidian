Use php artisan to create database migrations.  Database migration are basically php code used to connect to your database and perform some sort of SQL action such as creating a table.  Like most things there is a convention for creating tables in your database and naming the migrations.

Here is an example artisan command to create a DB table named blogs.  (Notice it is blogs plural)

```
php artisan make:migration create_blogs_table
```

The above command will create a php class in the database/migrations folder.

The previous migrations will already have been run when you initialised your Laravel app.
Note: The new table will not yet exist in the database.  As the initial migrations ran at create time the database will already have these tables.

The create_blogs_table migration will have 2 functions, up and down.  If you followed the standard naming conventions Laravel will know to create a table with the name "blogs".

```
public function up(): void
{
	Schema::create('blogs', function (Blueprint $table) {
		$table->id();
		$table->timestamps();
	});
}
```

Above is the boilerplate from the artisan command.  To add further columns simply edit the function.  A full list of column types can be found here...

https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/migrations#available-column-types

<u>Example</u>

```
public function up(): void
{
	Schema::create('blogs', function (Blueprint $table) {
		$table->id();
		$table->string('title');
		$table->text('description);
		$table->timestamps();
	});
}
```

To create the table in the database we simply need to run...

```
php artisan migrate
```

Back in Table Plus or MyPHPAdmin you should now find the new table.

Notice that timestamps created 2 columns automatically for us.


## Migration Commands

If you run php artisan list it will give a full list of all the artisan command here are the ones specific to migrations.
