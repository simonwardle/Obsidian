Use the following command to create a model.

```
php artisan make:model Blog
```

You can add options to the above to automatically create the table migration and the controller.

```
php artisan make:model Blog -mc
```

Artisan is clever enough to pluralise the table name so you will get a new table named blogs.


## None Conventional Naming

If for some reason you need to make a model  with a name that does not match an underlying table it is possible.
Simply run the same make model command but with your chosen name.

```
php artisan make:model NewBlog
```

Then within the new model add the following line of code.

The NewBlog model will now be connected to the blogs table.
