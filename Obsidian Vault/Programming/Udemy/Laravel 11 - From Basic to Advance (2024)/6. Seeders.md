Use php artisan to create a seeder.

```
php artisan make:seeder UserSeeder
```

This will create a new class UserSeeder in the folder database/seeders.  In the class edit the function run().

```
public function run(): void
{
	User::create(
		[
			'name' => 'Joe Bloggs',
			'email' => 'joe.bloggs@example.com',
			'password' => 'password'
		]
	);
}

```

To run the UserSeeder.

```
php artisan db:seed UserSeeder
```

You should then find your user table has been populated.

Notice the password has been automatically hashed.  This is because the User model has code in a casts() function.

If you have multiple tables and want them to be all seeded at once then you can add the following code to the run() function in the DatabaseSeeder file.

```
$this->call(UserSeeder::class);
```

==NOTE== If you migrate your database and then run the following command.

```
php artisan db:seeder
```

Your database will be populated with your seed data.  If you then try to run the same command again later you will probably get the following error.

You can't insert the same user again as their is a unique constraint in place.
You can either refresh, reset or fresh your migrations or you may want to just comment out the offending line in the DatabaseSeeder class.  See  [[4. Database Migration]] and [[7. Factories]].
