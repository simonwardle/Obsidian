Factories are used to generate data for your database tables.   You could hard code some data to be used similar to the example shown in [[6. Seeders]] but usually the factories is used to automatically generate multiple rows of fake test data in the correct format.

The name of the factory is very important.  It must match the name of the model for which it is producing the fake data.  

In the database we have the table blogs which has the model blog.  The factory must be named the same as the model.  BlogFactory.

```
php artisan make:factory BlogFactory
```

The above will automatically generate the class in the database/factories folder and name it BlogFactory.

Notice below the the comment, this is why the naming is important.

To complete the factory class we have to complete the definition function here is an example of what is required.

```
return [
	'title' => fake()->sentence(3),
	'description' => fake()->paragraph(3,true)
];
```

Then back in the DatabaseSeeder class we just need to call the factory like this...

```
Blog::factory(10)->create();
```

This will create 10 rows in the database for us if we just run this.

```
php artisan db:seed
```

If we look at the table notice it has automatically updated the timestamp columns for us as well.
