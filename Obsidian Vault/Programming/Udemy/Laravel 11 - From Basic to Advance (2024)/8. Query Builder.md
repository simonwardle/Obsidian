To use the the query builder you must include the DB class, include this at the top of your code.

```
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
```

## Create

Here are some examples of the query builder in action.  The example below will insert a new row into the products table.

```
DB::table('products')->insert([
	'name' => 'Test Item',
	'description' => 'This was inserted for testing only.',
	'quantity' => 12,
	'price' => 29.99,
	'created_at' => now(),
	'updated_at' => now()
]);
```

To insert more than one row at a time.
Notice the two rows are wrapped in an array.

```
DB::table('products')->insert(
[
	[
	'name' => 'Test Item 10',
	'description' => 'This was inserted for testing only.',
	'quantity' => 10,
	'price' => 1029.99,
	'created_at' => now(),
	'updated_at' => now()
	],
	[
	'name' => 'Test Item 11',
	'description' => 'This was inserted for testing only.',
	'quantity' => 11,
	'price' => 1129.99,
	'created_at' => now(),
	'updated_at' => now()
	]
]);
```

##  Read

Using query builder it is pretty much the same as above but here is an example.

```
$products = DB::table('products')->get();
return $products;
```

This will return JSON.

It is possible to add a where clause to your query.

```
$products = DB::table('products')->where('quantity', '>', 50)
->orderBy('quantity')->get()->firstOrFail();

return $products;
```

You can chain where clauses as well.

```
$products = DB::table('products')->
	where('quantity', '80')->
	where('price', '>', 1000)->get();

return $products;
```

## Update

In addition to inserting records into the database, the query builder can also update existing records using the update method. The update method, like the insert method, accepts an array of column and value pairs indicating the columns to be updated. The update method returns the number of affected rows. You may constrain the update query using where clauses:

```
$products = DB::table('products')
			->where('quantity', 80)
			->where('price', '>', 1000)
			->update([
				'description' => 'We changed this one!',
				'updated_at' => now()
			]
);
```

## Delete

The query builder's delete method may be used to delete records from the table. The delete method returns the number of affected rows. You may constrain delete statements by adding "where" clauses before calling the delete method:

```
$deleted = DB::table('products')
			->where('quantity', 80)
			->where('price', '>', 1000)
			->delete();
return $deleted;
```

## Select specific columns

The pluck function.

This will return the name with the id as the key.
