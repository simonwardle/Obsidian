To use the the query builder you must include the DB class, include this at the top of your code.

```
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
```

## Create

Here are some examples of the query builder in action.  The example below will insert a new row into the products table.

```
DB::table('products')->insert([
	'name' => 'Test Item',
	'description' => 'This was inserted for testing only.',
	'quantity' => 12,
	'price' => 29.99,
	'created_at' => now(),
	'updated_at' => now()
]);
```

To insert more than one row at a time.
Notice the two rows are wrapped in an array.

```
DB::table('products')->insert(
[
	[
	'name' => 'Test Item 10',
	'description' => 'This was inserted for testing only.',
	'quantity' => 10,
	'price' => 1029.99,
	'created_at' => now(),
	'updated_at' => now()
	],
	[
	'name' => 'Test Item 11',
	'description' => 'This was inserted for testing only.',
	'quantity' => 11,
	'price' => 1129.99,
	'created_at' => now(),
	'updated_at' => now()
	]
]);
```

##  Read

Using query builder it is pretty much the same as above but here is an example.

```
$products = DB::table('products')->get();
return $products;
```

This will return JSON.

It is possible to add a where clause to your query.

```
$products = DB::table('products')->where('quantity', '>', 50)
->orderBy('quantity')->get()->firstOrFail();

return $products;
```

You can chain where clauses as well.

```
$products = DB::table('products')->
	where('quantity', '80')->
	where('price', '>', 1000)->get();

return $products;
```
