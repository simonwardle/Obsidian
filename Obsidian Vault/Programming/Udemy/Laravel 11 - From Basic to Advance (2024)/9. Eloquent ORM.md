Laravel includes Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database. When using Eloquent, each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. In addition to retrieving records from the database table, Eloquent models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.

## Create

Below is an example of the simplest method to insert data into the database using Eloquent.
Basically create a new instance of the desired model, set the values and save.
```
$product = new Product();
$product->name = 'Eloquent Product';
$product->description = 'Added using the Eloquent ORM';
$product->quantity = 1;
$product->price = 100.00;
$product->created_at = now();
$product->updated_at = now();

$product->save();
```


## Read

To retrieve all rows.
```
$products = Product::all();
dd($products);
```

Obviously we can foreach over these like this.
```
$products = Product::all();

foreach($products as $product){
	echo $product->name . ' ' . $product->quantity;
	echo "<br>";
}
```

We can also use where like this.
```
$products = Product::where('quantity', '>=', 50)->orderBy('quantity')->first();
dd($products);
```
The above will return the first row where the quantity is greater than or equal to 50.

We can string together other clauses and even use LIKE.
```
$products = Product::where('description', 'LIKE', '%sit%')
			->orWhere('quantity', '>=', 80 )
			->get();
```

We can also use where in.
```
$products = Product::whereIn('id', [1, 3, 5, 6,7])->get();
dd($products);
```

To find a row by id we can use the find function.
```
$products = Product::find(1);
dd($products);
```


## Update

First retrieve the row or rows you want to update then update the column and finally save the changes.
```
$products = Product::find(1);
$products->price = 8000.00;
$products->quantity = 5;
$products->save();

dd($products);
```


## Delete

Same as update, retrieve the row you want to delete and then just delete it.
Example 1
```
$product = Product::find(1);
$product->delete();
```

Example 2
```
$product = Product::find(1)->delete();
```

The above code would fail if id 1 does not exist, to code around this use the function findOrFail(1).
Laravel with fall back to 404 not found.
```
$product = Product::findOrFail(1)->delete();
```
