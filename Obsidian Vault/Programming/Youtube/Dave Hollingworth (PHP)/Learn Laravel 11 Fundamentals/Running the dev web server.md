#laravel 

Once you have created a Laravel project it is really simple to get it running.

Example
```
cd Source/laravel/pluralsight
laravel new blog
code blog
```

The above will create a new folder blog and populate it for you with a bare bones Laravel project.  Then code blog will open this in Visual Studio Code.

Open a terminal in VS Code and enter the command.

```
php artisan serve
```

This will start up a web server.
Browse to localhost:8000 and you should see a site.
