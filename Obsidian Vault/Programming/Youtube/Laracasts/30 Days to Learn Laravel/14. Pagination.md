If you have hundreds and hundreds of pages it could be slow.

To switch to simple pagination simple change paginate(3) to simplePaginate(3).  This will just give you Next and Previous buttons on a page rather than page numbers.

cursorPaginate is also an option and is very perform-ant but gives strange urls.


## Not using Tailwind

Enter the command below in a terminal
```
php artisan vendor:publish
```

Search for pagination and down arrow to select the tag.

This will copy from the vendor package into your resources folder.
