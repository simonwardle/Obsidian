Instead of using tinker to use a factory to populate tables manually in your database we can use database seeding.

Using tinker to insert 100 records into the Job table

Due to the way the Job factory is configured it will also insert into the Employer table random data from fake().

To setup seeding edit the DatabaseSeeder.php file.
Here is a working example.

![[Pasted image 20240905154301.png]]

The above will create one new user "John Doe" and create 200 random job titles and the corresponding employer for the job.

```
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

The above command basically drops all the tables and all your data and then creates all the tables and populates them with seed data.

Artisan can be used to generate Seeder classes for you. For example we could create a JobSeeder class that is then called from the DatabaseSeeder class.

```
php artisan make:seeder
```

The above will create the class for you in the correct folder you just need to pick a name and then populate the function.

Then back in the DatabaseSeeder class...
