In web.php you need to be aware that the order of the routes does matter.

If you have the following code.
```
Route::get('/jobs/{id}', function ($id))....

Followed by

Route::get('/jobs/create', function ())
```

The second route will never be called because the first route is a wildcard so if someone enters jobs/create in the browser it will simply match the wildcard.

To get started with a layout you can just grab one from here for free...
