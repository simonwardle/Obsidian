In web.php you need to be aware that the order of the routes does matter.

If you have the following code.
```
Route::get('/jobs/{id}', function ($id))....

Followed by

Route::get('/jobs/create', function ())
```

The second route will never be called because the first route is a wildcard so if someone enters jobs/create in the browser it will simply match the wildcard.

To get started with a layout you can just grab one from here for free...

## CSRF Token

Important thing to remember is a csrf token.
Laravel has a directive of @csrf when placed in a form it will automatically create a hidden field and populate with a token.
If you forget this you will get a 419 Expired page error.

## Fillable Fields

Other issues could be because the model has $fillable fields.
In this example we have the following code in the Job model..

![[Pasted image 20240909185705.png]]

In our post rout we are trying to do this..

![[Pasted image 20240909185811.png]]
We will get this error..

 This is because employer_id is missing from $fillable fields in the Job model.
 To fix we can just add the employer_id, or take a different approach.
 Instead of having to list every field we want to be fillable we could just list the ones we don't want to be fillable to do this we would change the model to this..

This basically disables fillable fields.
