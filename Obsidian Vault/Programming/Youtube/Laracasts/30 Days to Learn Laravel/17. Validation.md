Basic browser side validation can be achieved by adding the keyword required to an input.

The above is just the first step in validation.
To help with testing server side validation it's easier to remove the client side validation.

This is very simple server side validation.

If you now test your page and fail validation by leaving fields empty Laravel will not create the row in the database, it will generate an error but you need to display it somewhere.

Adding something like this to your form will display the basic errors.
This will loop through each error and place a list on the form.

To make the errors specific to a field place this under each field simply replace the name of the field.
