## Routes

The long winded way to define routes in the web.php is as follows

```
Route::get('/jobs/{id}', function ($id) {
	$job = Job::find($id);
	return view('jobs.show', ['job' => $job]);
});
```

There is a better way but you must follow conventions.
The above can be replaced with this.

```
Route::get('/jobs/{job}', function (Job $job) {
	return view('jobs.show', ['job' => $job]);
});
```

Notice the {job} in the get must have the same name as the variable passed into the function and the variable must have a type specified in this case Job.

Because you have specified the type Job Laravel knows to try and give you a Job type.


## Route Views

If you want to simply call a view from a route with no other logic in place, Laravel has a short cut.  
Replace this..
```
Route::get('/', function () {
	return view('home');
});
```

With this..
```
Route::view('/', 'home');
```

It just makes web.php cleaner.

## Route Listing

To get a neat list of just your routes use the following artisan command

```
php artisan route:list --except-vendor
```

## Controller Classes

To make a controller.
```
php artisan make:controller
```
Artisan will ask for a name and then a type.  In this example we chose JobController and Empty.

Within the JobController class add functions for each of your end points and then back in the route file (web.php) call those new functions.  Here is an example using dd to sanity check it before changing everything.

In web.php add this..
![[Pasted image 20240918155614.png]]
In the controller add this..
![[Pasted image 20240918155655.png]]

The output should look like this..
![[Pasted image 20240918155752.png]]

Next add the functionality you had in the web.php file into the controller so the code will look like this..
```
public function index()
{
	$jobs = Job::with('employer')->latest()->simplePaginate(5);

	return view('jobs.index', [
		'jobs' => $jobs
	]);
}
```

We have migrated from a route closure to a dedicated controller action.

## Route Groups

In the web.php file if you want to stop repeating the name of the controller you can create a group function which takes the code from this..

## Route Resources

Laravel is really clever if you stick to conventions and name your functions as previously shown.  (index, create, show, store, edit, update and destroy).  Instead of naming each route as shown in previous sections you can replace the entire thing this.

```
Route::resource('jobs', JobController::class);
```

If you delete the existing route group for the job and replace it with the line above everything will simply just work.   Laravel automatically just sets everything up to follow the typical convention.  This only works if you are consistent with the naming conventions.

If you don't need to generate all seven resourceful  routes Laravel does have an extension.
To generate the resource for all actions except edit you could do this..
```
Route::resource('jobs', JobController::class,[
	'except' => ['edit']
]);
```

To only create an index and a show you could do this..

```
Route::resource('jobs', JobController::class,[
	'only' => ['index', 'show']
]);
```
