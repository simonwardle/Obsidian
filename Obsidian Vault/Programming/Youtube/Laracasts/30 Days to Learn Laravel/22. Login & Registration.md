## Passwords

In your registration form name the password confirmation field "password_confirmation" and also give it the same id. In the controller you can use this to automatically handle password confirmations.

In the controller store function the validation process can look like this...

Laravel will then know to automatically check the two password fields are the same without you having to do any further work.

This could be applied to any field not just password, simply add confirmed as a validation attribute and Laravel will look for another field with the same name plus _confirmation.


## The example

In the example app the user registers on the site by clicking the Register button which takes them to /register using a get request, if we look in web.php we find this takes them to the RegisterUserController and the create function which simply calls a view of the register form.

Once they have entered their details in to the register form and clicked the Register button (the register form has a POST method) the web.php route sends them to the store function in the RegisterUserController where their details are validated.  A new user is created and is logged in using the built in Auth::login function.

## Password Hashed

If you look in the database after successfully creating a user you find the password has been hashed.

This has happened automatically because within the User model we have the following code...

You can test this using tinker

## Log Out

Log out requests should really be POST requests to stop malicious users from simply calling the log out from an unrelated site.

## Validation
When logging in the user might input an incorrect password.  There is a really neat way to catch this error.  Use the throw ValidationException::withMessages.  Here is a working example.

The error will be thrown automatically back to the form and displayed against the email field.

Notice the email field has been wiped out which would be annoying for the end users to fix this we can implement the following.

Adding the call to old('email') will solve this issue notice the : prefixing the value
