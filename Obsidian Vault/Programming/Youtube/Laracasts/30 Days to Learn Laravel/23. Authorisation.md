## Inline authorisation

In the example app it is possible to edit a job even if you are not signed in.  To stop this in the JobController, edit function we can easily stop this with the following in line check.

This basically forces a guest or user who has NOT been authorised yet to login.

Just because a user is signed in they should not be allowed to edit a job they did not create or are not responsible for.

We can check this as follows.

The above is basically saying if the current "Authorised User" isNot the same as the user who belongs to the employer who owns the job then abort displaying 403 FORBIDDEN.

All this is possible because of the DB relationships that have been put in place in DB migrations and then in the models the following functions have been added.
![[Pasted image 20240923183118.png]]
The above Job model has the function employer() which states the Job belongs to an Employer.

![[Pasted image 20240923182922.png]]

The above Employer model has the function user which states the Employer belongs to a User.  Or think of it like this $this(employer) belongs to a User.



In the DB we have Employers who belong to a User notice the user_id.

The User creates Jobs that belong to an Employer.

The User with the id 55 is

If we login as this user using the a password of "password" we should now be able to edit this one job but not the others.

## Gates
The above is all well and good in that yes it will stop an unauthorised user editing the selected job.  However, the UI still shows the Edit button and this really isn't the desired approach.  The problem is the logic which controllers the authorisation is stuck inside the controller. 

This is where Gates can help.

Gates are barriers if you are authorised the gate will open.  Gates can be implemented in the AppServiceProvider here is an example.

We have taken the logic applied earlier and moved into this Gate named "edit-job".  The User will always be the currently authenticated user but the Job will need to be passed in.  If the user is a guest (not signed in) the Gate will always fail.  If this is NOT the desired response you could change the User to be optional (?User).

Now we have a Gate in place we can change the controller to use it and add in code to the form see below.

The controller edit function...

The show form changes to the Edit Job button.

![[Pasted image 20240925121115.png]]

The above is basically saying if the user can "edit-job" (checking the Gate) display the Edit Job button

## Middleware Authorisation

The details above are great but the Gate would probably need to be referenced in the Controller for every function, edit, update destroy etc.  Obviously there is could be some repetition.

An alternative is to perform the authorisation on the route level by making use of middleware.

The route in web.php would need to change to this...![[Pasted image 20240925152659.png]]

The call to the Gate could the simply be removed from the controller.

## Policies

Policies are connected to your eloquent model.  Use artisan to create a policy

```
php artisan make:policy
```

![[Pasted image 20240925195205.png]]


The above has created the JobPolicy.php file and populated with example code.  Using the same requirements as earlier we could edit this policy to have just one function "edit" like this.

![[Pasted image 20240925195834.png]]

Now we just need to edit the web.php file and change the call to the can function.

![[Pasted image 20240925195953.png]]

Laravel is clever enough to work out that you mean the edit function on the JobPolicy.
We would also need to edit the button on the view.
