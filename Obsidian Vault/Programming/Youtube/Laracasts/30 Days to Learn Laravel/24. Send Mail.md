## Mailable

To send mail we first need to create something called a mailable to do this use artisan.

```
php artisan maike:mail
```

This will ask for a name.  In this example "JobPosted".

Artisan will create a new folder and a JobPosted.php file.

Simply create a very simple view job-posted.blade.php with a small message, then add a new route to web.php.

In the browser you can now view the body of the email.

## Sending Locally

Just to test you have everything setup how you want in your mail you can change the route in the web.php to this...

Then again browse to the end point in your browser.

Next browse to storage/logs/laravel.log and you should see the body of your email.

Notice the From: address.  This can be configured.  See the file config/mail.php and .env.
The recommendation is to set this in the .env file.
It is also possible to override in the JobPosted class.

## Mailtrap.io

To test with a real / fake external smtp server use mailtrap.io.
I created an account using my google account as login.
Copied and pasted the details provided into my .env file

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=9e195713c2bfea
MAIL_PASSWORD=********3d35
```

Test again from the browser and the email should just go to the inbox.

## Sending the mail
Obviously in the example app the correct place to send the mail would be when a new job is created successfully.  Here is the an example of the code in the JobController class.

Notice now the $job is passed into the JobPosted class to allow access to the data to show in the final email.
